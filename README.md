## HEP, Astro, Cosmo
A very detailed explanation (I liked) of the LEE effect is Richard's [Higgs Discovery and the Look Elsewhere Effect](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/10791/4/%28PhilSci_online_first_version_26.06.2014%29Higgs_and_Look_Elsewhere_Effect.pdf).

[Classic CMB Tutorials](http://background.uchicago.edu/index.html) by Wayne Hu and a good Scientific American [article](http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/Papers/HuWhi04.pdf) on it.

A good summary of the [weak interaction and the CP violation due to the V-A interaction](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/boyd/stuff/neutrinolectures/weak.pdf).

A good discussion from the [QM perspective of neutrino oscillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05232v1).

A talk on [neutron EDM](https://indico.cern.ch/event/922791/) results. Good talk on [antihydrogen](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1007548/) research at CERN.

[Supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2746536) by Andrea Ghez.

A good talk on [NOvA](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/967/contributions/5071/attachments/4128/4850/NOvA_xsecResults.pdf) long baseline neutrino experiment and a talk focusing on [neutrino detection techniques](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1019325/) with Cherenkov or scintillation lights.

The [first result from muon g-2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81PfYnpuOPA) where a 4.2 sigma tension with the SM prediction is found.

## Detectors, CMS
Self contained talks on detector technologies ([calorimatery](https://indico.desy.de/indico/event/26403/other-view?view=standard#2020-07-28) and [tracking](https://indico.desy.de/indico/event/26403/other-view?view=standard#2020-07-29)) at a summer school. 

A good lecture on [semiconductor detectors](https://indico.cern.ch/event/941945/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes#day-2020-10-19) by Roger Rusack explaining why we need to dope semiconductors to make them work at room temperature. Other talks like [Bethe-Bloch ionization](https://indico.cern.ch/event/941945/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes#2-lecture-2), CMS [pixel detector](https://indico.cern.ch/event/941945/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes#34-lecture-5-the-phase-1-pixel), and [L1 trigger](https://indico.cern.ch/event/941945/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes#50-spring-lecture-21-the-new-l) (where Michail mentioned structures in eye diagram, how it's related to bit error rate, and an interesting fiberglass effect on impedance for high frequency signals in PCB) in the same page are good in general.

The first paper on [high energy muon at CMS](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/15/02/P02027).

A thorough discription of the challenging [tracking at CMS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.6569.pdf), which also explains why electrons, not like muons, lose energy in a non-Gaussian way by bremsstrahlung and can't use the standard Kalman filter for its tracking.

Two short papers ([1](https://cds.cern.ch/record/927395/files/NOTE2006_032.pdf) and [2](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/110/9/092009/pdf)) talks about the Kalman vertex fitting prob features. A concise [note on the Kalman filter in general](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6279585).

The scintillators at CMS for hadron detections apply a so-called [Forster mechanism](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2702214/files/PRF-18-003-paper-v10.pdf).

A series of talks on [signals in particle detectors](https://indico.cern.ch/event/843083/) by Werner Riegler (CERN), where he emphasizes the signal creation process is due to charge induction, not charge collection.

Study of TeV neutrino at LHC ([1](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6471/ab3f7c), [2](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6471/aba7ad)).

Good overview of [CSC electronics](https://indico.cern.ch/event/750612) at CMS.

## Accelerators, Colliders
A good LHC user [guide](https://indico.cern.ch/event/941945/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes#7-lecture-7).

A self contained [talk on current synchrotron accelerator technology](https://indico.desy.de/indico/event/26403/other-view?view=standard#2020-07-27) explaining how bend, focus and acceleration of beams are done.

A series of [dedicated talks on accelerator technologies](https://video.ucdavis.edu/playlist/details/1_ijw40h9n) by Eric Prebys where he covered transverse and longitudinal motion of the beam, the FODO cells (quadrupole magnets) and the dipole magnets, the concept of rigidity, multi-staged acceleration and synchrotron radiations. 

I am very interested in new accelerator technologies, for example the [muon collider](http://muoncollider.web.cern.ch/). People starts to identify the community interest with a goal to build a demo in the second half of this decade. 

Direct dark matter search experiment like [Xenon1T](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.072004) uses the [Migdal effect](https://science.purdue.edu/xenon1t/?tag=migdal-effect) to get higher sensitivity to electronic recoils. Good [talks](https://vod.video.cornell.edu/media/LEPP+Journal+Club+-+Evan+Shockley/1_f9hqr34f).

Physics program at [FCC-ee](https://indico.cern.ch/event/941945/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes#55-the-fcc-ee-project) by Markus Klute talking about Higgs precision measurement and BSM searches.

## Statistics
A good talk on [GoF test](https://indico.cern.ch/event/972293/).

Good summaries of statistics by Robert Cousins on [statistics in HEP](http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cousins/stats/) and [CDF recommendations](https://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/statistics/recommendations/).

[Kernel estimation](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0010-4655(00)00243-5) for unbinned dataset that can be used to get p.d.f. of a small dataset.

A good [explanation](https://www.pp.rhul.ac.uk/~cowan/stat/medsig/medsigNote.pdf) of why we often use s/sqrt(b) (s<<b) for signal discovery significance.

## Medical Physics
Besides national defense industry (which is often not "friendly" to international job applicants), medical physics is probably the most relevant field where particle/nuclear/accelerator physics are used. These include, but not limited to, proton/heavy ion therapy for cancer, PET, CT, MRI, etc.
