## HEP, Astro, Cosmo
A very detailed explanation (I liked) of the LEE effect is Richard's [Higgs Discovery and the Look Elsewhere Effect](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/10791/4/%28PhilSci_online_first_version_26.06.2014%29Higgs_and_Look_Elsewhere_Effect.pdf).

[Classic CMB Tutorials](http://background.uchicago.edu/index.html) by Wayne Hu and a good Scientific American [article](http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/Papers/HuWhi04.pdf) on it.

A good summary of the [weak interaction and the CP violation due to the V-A interaction](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/boyd/stuff/neutrinolectures/weak.pdf).

Good summaries of statistics by Robert Cousins on [statistics in HEP](http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cousins/stats/) and [CDF recommendations](https://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/statistics/recommendations/).

A good discussion from the [QM perspective of neutrino oscillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05232v1).

A talk on [neutron EDM](https://indico.cern.ch/event/922791/) results.

## Detectors
Self contained talks on detector technologies ([calorimatery](https://indico.desy.de/indico/event/26403/other-view?view=standard#2020-07-28) and [tracking](https://indico.desy.de/indico/event/26403/other-view?view=standard#2020-07-29)) at a summer school. 

A good lecture on HEP [semiconductor detectors](https://indico.cern.ch/event/941945/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes#day-2020-10-19) by Roger Rusack explaining why we need to dope semiconductors to make them work at room temperature. Other talks such as [Bethe-Bloch ionization](https://indico.cern.ch/event/941945/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes#2-lecture-2) in the same page are good in general.

The first paper on [high energy muon at CMS](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/15/02/P02027).

A thorough discription of the challenging [tracking at CMS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.6569.pdf), which also explains why electrons, not like muons, lose energy in a non-Gaussian way by bremsstrahlung and can't use the standard Kalman filter for its tracking.

Two short papers ([1](https://cds.cern.ch/record/927395/files/NOTE2006_032.pdf) and [2](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/110/9/092009/pdf)) talks about the Kalman vertex fitting prob features. A concise [note on the Kalman filter in general](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6279585).

The scintillators at CMS for hadron detections apply a so-called [Forster mechanism](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2702214/files/PRF-18-003-paper-v10.pdf).

A series of talks on [signals in particle detectors](https://indico.cern.ch/event/843083/) by Werner Riegler (CERN), where he emphasizes the signal creation process is due to charge induction, not charge collection.

## Accelerators, Colliders
A good LHC user [guide](https://indico.cern.ch/event/941945/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes#7-lecture-7).

A self contained [talk on current synchrotron accelerator technology](https://indico.desy.de/indico/event/26403/other-view?view=standard#2020-07-27) explaining how bend, focus and acceleration of beams are done.

A series of [dedicated talks on accelerator technologies](https://video.ucdavis.edu/playlist/details/1_ijw40h9n) by Eric Prebys where he covered transverse and longitudinal motion of the beam, the FODO cells (quadrupole magnets) and the dipole magnets, the concept of rigidity, multi-staged acceleration and synchrotron radiations. 

I am very interested in new accelerator technologies, for example the [muon collider](http://muoncollider.web.cern.ch/). People starts to identify the community interest with a goal to build a demo in the second half of this decade. 

## Statistics
A good talk on [GoF test](https://indico.cern.ch/event/972293/).

## Medical Physics
Besides national defense industry (which is often not "friendly" to international job applicants), medical physics is probably the most relevant field where particle/nuclear/accelerator physics are used. These include, but not limited to, proton/heavy ion therapy for cancer, PET, CT, MRI, etc.
