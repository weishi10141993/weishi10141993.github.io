## CMS
A large collaboration like CMS makes it really hard for new guys to learn things quickly. When I got started into this business, I spent almost all my time asking around experts around the world. 
For the CMS software and trigger system, there is a good [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/803880/contributions/3343511/attachments/1823045/2982756/cmsHLTRecoV6.pdf).

High pT (showering) muons: [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/827830/contributions/3475196/attachments/1869241/3075133/ApprovalHighpT.pdf).

## Next Gen. Acc.
We are at a cross road of particle physics. People are stumbled on whether or not we should build a next gen acc. But the real underlying reason is we can't afford sky-high cost for traditional acc.

What makes me feel interested are the new technologies people are developing that will go into the next generations of accelerators. CERN proposed the plasma driven technology. Meanwhile, other people are proposing muon colliders (different schemes, proton/electron on target).

## Medical Physics
Besides national defense industry (which is often not "friendly" to international job applicants), medical physics is probably the most relevant field where particle/nuclear/accelerator physics are used. These include, but not limited to, proton/heavy ion therapy for cancer, PET, CT, MRI, etc.
