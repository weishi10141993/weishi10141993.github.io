## HEP, Astro, Cosmo
Large collaborations like CMS make it really hard for new guys to learn things quickly. Since I got started into this business, I spend a lot of time asking experts around the world on a daily basis. But I do ran into many good references in the past that are very illustrative and good for learning in a heruistic way.

For the CMS software and trigger system, there is a good [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/803880/contributions/3343511/attachments/1823045/2982756/cmsHLTRecoV6.pdf).

A good study of very high energy (showering) muons at CMS: [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/827830/contributions/3475196/attachments/1869241/3075133/ApprovalHighpT.pdf).

A very detailed explanation (I liked) of the LEE effect is Richard's [Higgs Discovery and the Look Elsewhere Effect](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/10791/4/%28PhilSci_online_first_version_26.06.2014%29Higgs_and_Look_Elsewhere_Effect.pdf).

Classic introduction to the [CMB](http://background.uchicago.edu/index.html) by Wayne Hu.

A good [summary](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/boyd/stuff/neutrinolectures/weak.pdf) of the weak interaction and the CP violation due to the V-A interaction.

## Next Gen. Acc.
We are at a cross road of particle physics. People are stumbled on whether or not we should build a next gen acc. But the real underlying reason is we can't afford sky-high cost for traditional acc.

What makes me feel interested are the new technologies people are developing that will go into the next generations of accelerators. CERN proposed the plasma driven technology. Meanwhile, other people are proposing muon colliders (different schemes, proton/electron on target).

## Medical Physics
Besides national defense industry (which is often not "friendly" to international job applicants), medical physics is probably the most relevant field where particle/nuclear/accelerator physics are used. These include, but not limited to, proton/heavy ion therapy for cancer, PET, CT, MRI, etc.
