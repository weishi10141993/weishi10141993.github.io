## HEP, Astro, Cosmo
Large collaborations like CMS make it really hard for new guys to learn things quickly. Since I got started into this business, I spend a lot of time asking experts around the world on a daily basis. But I do ran into many good references in the past that are very illustrative and good for learning in a heruistic way.

A very detailed explanation (I liked) of the LEE effect is Richard's [Higgs Discovery and the Look Elsewhere Effect](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/10791/4/%28PhilSci_online_first_version_26.06.2014%29Higgs_and_Look_Elsewhere_Effect.pdf).

[Classic introduction to the CMB](http://background.uchicago.edu/index.html) by Wayne Hu.

A good summary of the [weak interaction and the CP violation due to the V-A interaction](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/boyd/stuff/neutrinolectures/weak.pdf).

I've always been interested in the particle mass and its width. Depending on its decay modes, the width/mass shape could be quite different. Only when its far smaller than the detector resolution, they are approximated by gaussian profile. Another interesting phenomenon in HEP is the so-called [OZI rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OZI_rule), brought up in the 1960s. Certain decay modes is less frequent/suppressed than expected.

The scintillators at CMS for hadron detections apply a so-called Forster mechanism. More details in this [paper](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2702214/files/PRF-18-003-paper-v10.pdf).

A series of talks on [signals in particle detectors](https://indico.cern.ch/event/843083/) by Werner Riegler (CERN), where he emphasizes the signal creation process is due to charge induction, not charge collection.

Good summaries by Robert Cousins on [statistics in HEP](http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cousins/stats/).

## Next Gen. Acc.
We are at a cross road of particle physics. What makes me feel interested are the new technologies people are developing that will go into the next generations of accelerators. CERN proposed the plasma driven technology. Meanwhile, other people are proposing muon colliders (different schemes, proton/electron on target).

## Medical Physics
Besides national defense industry (which is often not "friendly" to international job applicants), medical physics is probably the most relevant field where particle/nuclear/accelerator physics are used. These include, but not limited to, proton/heavy ion therapy for cancer, PET, CT, MRI, etc.
